    "- Otter -> NMEA (original), CSV (processed)\n",
    "- \"Skippo\" GPS track from mobile phone (Sm√∏la) (?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow is as follows:\n",
    "- List / search for GPS track CSV file\n",
    "- List / search for video files\n",
    "- Use get_video_data() to get video data organized as Pandas dataframe. The function accepts time zone information.\n",
    "- Use xxx_csv_to_geodataframe() to get all CSV positions (where \"xxx\" represents\n",
    "  variations; \"otter\", \"track\", \"yx\") and return data as geodataframe. This can be very\n",
    "  densely sampled (tens of samples per second for Otter) or less densely sampled.\n",
    "- Reduce the number of data points by spatial filtering using filter_gdf_on_distance()\n",
    "- Cryptically \"prepare_gdf_with_video_data\", doing many things that probably could be\n",
    "  split into multiple functions: Excluding points outside video window. Adding video\n",
    "  file and relative time within video for each point. \n",
    "- Finally, using extract_images_from_video() to both extract images from video and save\n",
    "  the corresponding position in a GeoPackage file. **This function could be changed to\n",
    "  extract the image and save the position data as an EXIF tag instead**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code works, but \"smells\" a bit (according to my new preferences, at least). \n",
    "\n",
    "THe geodataframe format was chosen because it seemed like a good match with reading a\n",
    "CSV file with positions and writing a GPKG file with points. However, a workflow where\n",
    "the dataframe is continuously expanded and modified seems a bit clunky. Or? Does it just\n",
